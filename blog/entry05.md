Over the past few weeks, I continued learning how to use the Open-Meteo API to get weather data for my app while also finishing my MVP. To do this, I used both the [Nominatim API](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/3.6/develop/Postcodes/), and [Open-Meteo APi](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs?latitude=40.7143&longitude=-74.006&current=temperature_2m&forecast_days=1) to improve my understanding and build new features.

 ### How I finished my MVP:
