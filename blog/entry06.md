# Entry 6 (Presentation and Expo)
##### 5/28/25

## Content 
Once we completed our website, we had to present it to our classmates. We created slides to explain how we built the project, what we learned, and to show off the final product. These are my [Presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s_hvhWMDXesKM_DZc7V6YuKIWfaHbFl2Gi1GlfiisEk/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p).


I was a little nervous before my presentation, but I was also confident because I had practiced a lot. Practicing helped me prepare what I wanted to say and made me feel ready. Once I started speaking, my nervousness went away and I felt more comfortable. Being confident before I began helped me do better and share my project clearly with the audience. This experience taught me that practicing and believing in myself are important for a good presentation. Another lesson I learned is that slides don’t need to be overloaded with text. I made sure not to have a lot of text on my slides and instead included more images and visuals. Having more pictures helps keep the audience engaged and makes it easier to explain ideas without relying on words alone. Using images makes the presentation feel more dynamic and keeps the focus on the conversation rather than just reading from the screen. I think this approach helped me connect better with my audience.

After the presentations, we had an expo where everyone shared their projects informally in a “science fair” style setup in the cafeteria. Alumni judges were there to evaluate the projects and pick finalists. For this, we had to prepare an elevator pitch—a short, persuasive summary of our work. Here’s a link to my [Elevator Pitch Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18G3r9jk1bmDWJ3BkuWVXHI64NJDcVR7q2WBbFT5J0dE/edit?tab=t.0)

One important takeaway from the expo was to be natural when talking about your project. I realized it’s okay not to follow your elevator pitch word for word. Being yourself and speaking naturally helps make a better connection with your audience.

## Engineering Design Process
During this part of the project, I was at step 8 of the engineering design process, which focuses on communicating the results. This stage was all about sharing the final version of my website with others including my classmates, teachers, and judges. It gave me the chance to explain how I built the project, what challenges I faced, and what I learned along the way. Communicating the results was important because it helped me reflect on my work and also get feedback from others. Presenting my project allowed me to practice my public speaking skills and build confidence.

## Skills
Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **communication** and **organization**.
### Communication
A key skill I developed during this part of the project was communication. Presenting my website to my peers helped me improve as a public speaker. I learned how to explain my ideas clearly and confidently, which made sharing my work much easier and more effective.

### Organization
Another important skill I gained was organization. Preparing slides and an elevator pitch required me to carefully organize my thoughts and decide what information was most important to share. This experience taught me how to structure my ideas so that my presentation and expo talks were clear, focused, and easy to follow.
