  Over the winter break, I have made significant progress in improving and expanding the weather app I started. I added weather icons to represent different conditions like sunny, cloudy, and rainy. Using the Open Meteo API, I was able to display these icons alongside the weather details, making the app more visually appealing. I also integrated the Geolocation API, so the app automatically detects the userâ€™s location and shows the weather for that area, saving the user from manually entering their location.

```js
if (weatherCondition === "Clear") {
    document.body.style.backgroundImage = "url('sunny.jpg')";
    weatherIcon.src = "sun-icon.png";
} else if (weatherCondition === "Rain") {
    document.body.style.backgroundImage = "url('rainy.jpg')";
    weatherIcon.src = "rain-icon.png";
}
```
