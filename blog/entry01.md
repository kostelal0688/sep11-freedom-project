## Choosing a Tool & Topic
For my year-long project, I’ve chosen to work with JSON APIs. JSON APIs enable different applications to communicate through a standardized format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This format allows apps to easily exchange data—such as user information, product details, or weather updates by structuring the data in a clear, easy-to-understand way. This clarity not only helps developers work more efficiently but also reduces errors, speeding up development.

The app I’m developing will provide users with personalized outfit suggestions based on the current weather conditions. By integrating a weather JSON API, I can pull real-time data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts, to generate outfit recommendations.

To gain a better understanding of JSON APIs, I watched a helpful tutorial on [Weather JSON APIs tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHAAT9cnQlY) and followed along in jsbin. I also read the article [Designing and implementing a weather data API](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/designing-and-implementing-a-weather-data-api) to learn best practices for integrating weather APIs. Additionally, I completed several  [W3schools Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) tutorials to strengthen my understanding of JSON and its usage in JavaScript.

Through experimentation in jsbin, I worked on a small project that displayed the current weather in New York. Here’s an image of what I created:  [NY Weather](ny-weather.png). As I continued to explore JSON APIs, I tested various endpoints and learned how to process the data returned by the weather API. This allowed me to display useful weather information for users.

For my final app, I plan to go beyond just showing the temperature. I want to incorporate additional weather factors—such as humidity, wind speed, and detailed forecasts—so users can get a complete view of the conditions. Based on this data, the app will suggest what to wear, recommending outfits for cold weather (like a jacket) or warm days (such as lighter clothing). This will ensure users have a seamless, personalized experience whenever they check the weather and get outfit advice.

## Engineering Design Process 
I am currently in steps 1 and 2 of the engineering design process, which focus on defining and researching. First, we defined our topic, which helped us understand what we wanted to create. Next, we researched our tool to find out which one would work best for our project. This involved looking up different options, reading about their features, and checking out reviews. By doing this, we could make an informed choice about the tools we would use for our app.

## Skills 
Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **consideraion,** and **how to google**
### Consideration
One skill that I learned during this experience is consideration. While deciding on my tool, I had to carefully evaluate various factors to determine what would be most beneficial for my app. This involved taking into account the requirements of my users, like user-friendliness and the quick access to precise weather information. I had to also consider the technical abilities of various APIs, looking for one that offered reliable performance. 

### How to Google 
Another skill that I learned during this experience is how to Google effectively. To choose my tool, I needed to research different options and find the best one for my app. This meant using specific search terms to find useful articles, tutorials, and user reviews. I learned how to quickly spot reliable sources and gather the information I needed.
## Summary
To conclude, I am really excited to continue working on this project. My next step is to start planing my app.
