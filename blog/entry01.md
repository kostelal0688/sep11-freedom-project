# Entry 1 (Choosing a Tool and Topic)

## Choosing a Tool & Topic
The tool that I have chosen for the year-long project is JSON APIs. JSON APIs allow various applications to communicate through a standard format known as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Apps are able to easily exchange data, like user information or product details, by using them. JSON APIs structure data in a clear way, making it easier for developers to understand and work with. This helps speed up development and reduces errors. 

I will create a app where it shows you what to wear based on the weather. In my app, users will receive personalized outfit suggestions based on the current weather conditions. Through the integration of a weather JSON API, I am able to get current information on temperature, and other weather factors.

## Engineering Design Process 
I am currently in steps 1 and 2 of the engineering design process, which focus on defining and researching. First, we defined our topic, which helped us understand what we wanted to create. Next, we researched our tool to find out which one would work best for our project. This involved looking up different options, reading about their features, and checking out reviews. By doing this, we could make an informed choice about the tools we would use for our app.

## Skills 
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned from working on this blog are **consideraion,** and **how to google**
### Consideration
One skill that I learned during this experience is consideration. While deciding on my tool, I had to carefully evaluate various factors to determine what would be most beneficial for my app. This involved taking into account the requirements of my users, like user-friendliness and the quick access to precise weather information. I had to also consider the technical abilities of various APIs, looking for one that offered reliable performance. 

### How to Google 
Another skill that I learned during this experience is how to Google effectively. To choose my tool, I needed to research different options and find the best one for my app. This meant using specific search terms to find useful articles, tutorials, and user reviews. I learned how to quickly spot reliable sources and gather the information I needed.
## Summary
To conclude, I am really excited to continue working on this project. My next step is to start planing.
