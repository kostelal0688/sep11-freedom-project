## Choosing a Tool & Topic
For my year-long project, I’ve chosen to work with JSON APIs. JSON APIs enable different applications to communicate through a standardized format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). This format allows apps to easily exchange data such as user information, product details, or weather updates by structuring the data in a clear and easy to understand way. This clarity not only helps developers work more efficiently but also reduces errors, speeding up development by creating a seamless interaction between systems.

The app I’m developing will provide users with personalized outfit suggestions based on the current weather conditions. By integrating a weather JSON API, I can pull real-time data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecast details, to generate outfit recommendations. The goal of this app is to help users plan their day, making it easier for them to decide what to wear based on reliable, up-to-date weather information.

To gain a better understanding of how to effectively work with JSON APIs, I watched a helpful tutorial on [Weather JSON APIs tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHAAT9cnQlY) and followed along in jsbin. I also read the article [Designing and implementing a weather data API](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/designing-and-implementing-a-weather-data-api) to learn best practices for integrating weather APIs and handling the data properly. Additionally, I completed several tutorials on [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) to strengthen my knowledge of JSON and its usage in JavaScript. These resources have been invaluable in helping me grasp the basics of API integration and improve my skills in handling real-time data.

As part of my learning process, I experimented with jsbin by creating a small project that displayed the current weather in New York. Here’s an image of what I created: [NY Weather](ny-weather.png). Through this hands-on experimentation, I learned how to interact with different API endpoints and process the data returned by the weather API. This allowed me to display useful weather information in a user-friendly format. I also explored various features the weather API offers, such as hourly forecasts, weather alerts, and historical weather data, all of which could enhance the user experience.

For my final app, I plan to expand the functionality beyond just showing the temperature. I want to incorporate additional weather factors, such as humidity, wind speed, air pressure, and detailed forecasts. This will provide users with a complete view of the weather conditions, allowing them to make more informed decisions. For example, if it's cold with high humidity, the app might recommend wearing a warm, moisture-wicking jacket. Alternatively, if it's a sunny day with light winds, it might suggest wearing lighter clothing like a T-shirt and shorts. By analyzing all these variables, the app will be able to provide tailored suggestions for different weather conditions.

Moreover, I aim to improve the user interface by offering intuitive features, such as an easy-to-navigate design, location-based weather, and automatic updates, ensuring users always receive the most current weather information. I plan to integrate geolocation functionality, allowing the app to automatically detect the user’s location and offer weather recommendations specific to that region.

Ultimately, this app will serve not only as a practical tool for weather-based outfit suggestions but also as an example of how API integration can simplify user experience. Through real-time data processing and personalized recommendations, users will be able to plan their daily outfits, knowing they have all the weather information they need right at their fingertips.

## Engineering Design Process 
I am currently in steps 1 and 2 of the engineering design process, which focus on defining and researching. First, we defined our topic, which helped us understand what we wanted to create. Next, we researched our tool to find out which one would work best for our project. This involved looking up different options, reading about their features, and checking out reviews. By doing this, we could make an informed choice about the tools we would use for our app.

## Skills 
Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **consideraion,** and **how to google**
### Consideration
One skill that I learned during this experience is consideration. While deciding on my tool, I had to carefully evaluate various factors to determine what would be most beneficial for my app. This involved taking into account the requirements of my users, like user-friendliness and the quick access to precise weather information. I had to also consider the technical abilities of various APIs, looking for one that offered reliable performance. 

### How to Google 
Another skill that I learned during this experience is how to Google effectively. To choose my tool, I needed to research different options and find the best one for my app. This meant using specific search terms to find useful articles, tutorials, and user reviews. I learned how to quickly spot reliable sources and gather the information I needed.
## Summary
To conclude, I am really excited to continue working on this project. My next step is to start planing my app.
