# Entry 2 (Learning My Tool)
##### 12/9/24
During the past few weeks I have been learning more about JSON APIs Open Meteo. To learn more about the tool I created a website where a user can check the weather in several cities and get clothing suggestions based on the temperature, with the ability to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature units. I used [Open Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) which is the official documentation for the Open Meteo API, with detailed information on how to make requests for weather data, including temperature, wind, precipitation, etc. Letâ€™s break it down into its components:

HTML Structure:
 * The HTML structure includes a heading, radio buttons to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit, a container (div with id="weather-info") where the weather data and clothing suggestions for different cities will be displayed, and a <script> tag where JavaScript functionality resides.

  ```html
     <h1>Dress Based on Weather</h1>
     <label><input type="radio" name="unit" id="celsius" checked> Celsius</label>
     <label><input type="radio" name="unit" id="fahrenheit"> Fahrenheit</label>
     <div id="weather-info"></div>
  ```
