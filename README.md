# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Kostela Lila**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **JSON APIS** in order to help me make **a website that tells you what clothes to wear based on the weather. It uses real weather data from the internet to help people choose the right outfit.**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Helps people dress right for the weather, so they stay comfortable and healthy.
* Makes planning your day easier by knowing the weather ahead.
* Saves money by avoiding buying clothes that donâ€™t fit the weather.
* Might help the environment by encouraging people to use their clothes better.
##### CONS
* The app depends on weather websites, so if they have problems, the app might not work.
* Using location data might raise privacy concerns.
* People might rely too much on the app and forget to check the weather themselves.
* Could affect jobs related to weather forecasting or styling.
