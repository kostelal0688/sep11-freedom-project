# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Kostela Lila**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **JSON APIS** in order to help me make **a website that tells you what clothes to wear based on the weather. It uses real weather data from the internet to help people choose the right outfit.**.
