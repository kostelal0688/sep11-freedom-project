# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Do you struggle with what to wear becuause of not knowing what the weather is like?

## Product
* My website gives the weather based on zip-code and gives advice of what to wear. 

## Process
* A picture of wireframe
* Plan
    * MVP: Used the Nominatim API to turn the zip code into latitude and longitude coordinates. If the zip code is invalid the app tells the user "Invalid zip code." If the zip code is valid, I used the coordinates to call the Open-Meteo API and get the current weather data.
    * Beyond MVP: use fahrenheit and celsius
 * Code snippets
     * APIS code
 

## Conclusion
* 

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
